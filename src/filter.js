/**
 * Builds the libavfilter graph that flattens a VR frame.
 *
 * The chain is two filters:
 *
 *   1. `crop` picks one eye out of the packed frame. Cropping costs nothing —
 *      it only moves the plane pointers — and it gives us free choice of eye,
 *      which `v360`'s own `in_stereo` handling does not (that always keeps the
 *      left one). Verified byte-identical to `in_stereo=sbs:out_stereo=2d`.
 *
 *   2. `v360` reprojects that eye onto a flat rectilinear image aimed at
 *      `yaw` / `pitch` with a `d_fov` diagonal field of view.
 *
 * `yaw`, `pitch` and `d_fov` are all runtime-settable options, so panning and
 * zooming go through `vf-command` and never rebuild the filter chain.
 * Everything else — projection, eye, output size, interpolation — is fixed at
 * build time and needs the chain re-created.
 *
 * Pure string building, no `iina` API use, unit tested with plain node.
